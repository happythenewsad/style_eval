This repo contains artifacts from my research with Professor Chris Callison-Burch (University of Pennsylvania).

`docs/writeup.pdf` is a good place to start.

The notebooks in this repository assume the existence of datasets that are not versioned, due to space issues. Notebooks will function properly if this repo:

```shell
https://github.com/cocoxu/Shakespeare
```

can be referenced from this project's root directory as `./data/shakespeare`
