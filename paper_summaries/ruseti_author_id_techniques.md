of Linguistic Features ](https://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/events/pan-12/pan12-papers-final/pan12-author-identification/ruseti12-notebook.pdf)

Paper identifies a small set of engineered features with high predictive power with respect to the author identification task, including:

- character trigrams
- POS bigrams and trigrams
- prevalence in-data of 32 common English suffixes
- sentence complexity: various metrics computed from parse trees
- ratio of direct speech to non-direct speech.
